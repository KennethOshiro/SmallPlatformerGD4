# SmallPlatformerGD4
Forked and ported to Godot 4 in one hour. Play the original here: https://nartier.itch.io/rundie

This fork mainly consists of small changes to make the demo run in Godot 4 (tested with Aplha 14). 
I will try to keep this repo up to date as newer snapshots are released by the Godot team. 

The actual mechanics feel a bit floaty and imprecise, but that also seems to be the case with the original Godot 3 version of the game.
